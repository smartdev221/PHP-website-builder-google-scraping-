All this happens under the hood. So all you have to do is select what you want to install and then run it. </p>

<p> Although software developed for 32-bit systems runs on 64-bit versions of Wine, it works best with 32-bit versions. Fortunately, changing the Wine architecture is pretty simple: </p>

<p> If you find that there are no PlayOnLinux programs, you may need to install these programs manually. However, before diving you should ask yourself a question: does your Wine work in 64-bit or 32-bit mode? <A href = "// www.makeuseof.com/tag/difference-32-bit-64-bit- Windows / ">

<p> Wine can use the Windows DLLs in addition to its own reverse engineering libraries. In many cases, this may contribute to better compatibility. However, for this you need to download it and explicitly ask Wine to use it. The Winetricks shell script automates this process, so you donâ€™t need to worry about the process. </p>

<p> Like Windows, Linux and Wine have different versions designed for specific computer architectures. You are probably using a 64-bit version of Linux and therefore the default 64-bit version of Wine. </p>

<div style="border: 1px solid #eee;"><p><h2 id="1">How can I tell if my wine is 32 or 64 bit?</h2>Go to the WINEPREFIX / drive_c / folder and find the "Programs" folder. If you see only program files and no program files (x86) are available, use the 32-bit wine prefix. If you see both of them, use the 64-bit wine prefix.</p></div>%middle%<p> Different programs are based on different DLLs. Therefore, I recommend looking for installation instructions in the official Wine application database. Just find the software catThe other you want, and you will surely see others in the same boat as you. </p>

<p> In other words, Wine launches Windows software, reversing the development of parts of the Windows operating system for Linux. In the Microsoft world, these components are called DLLs (dynamic link libraries). They provide additional functions necessary for the operation of other programs. An example of this is d3d8.dll, which allows programs to access Microsoft DirectX 8 game functionality.>

<p> Suffice it to say that there are many DLLs of which Wine offers equivalents. Wine may have implementation errors. Guilt may not be! These are the main reasons why Windows programs behave badly or do not work under Linux. Therefore, the following steps are designed to bring Wine implementations as close as possible to Windows. </p>

<h2 id="12"> Installing Programs Using PlayOnLinux </h2>

<p style="border: 1px solid #eee;"><h2 id="2">How do I completely remove wine?</h2>Open a terminal and run the command prompt: Wine Uninstaller. In the window that appears, select the application that you want to remove. Click the Delete button in the lower right corner. Repeat this process for other Windows software that you want to uninstall.</p><p> Just add the first two commands, as you did when you created the new Wine folder. You may need to restart your computer for these settings to work. Then you can run programs with a simple  The wine [program] command </p>

<h2 id="13"> Use An Intermediate Version Of Wine </h2>

<p> If you want to run a program with this version of Wine, you must first enter the first two commands. It can be a little tiring. If you want to use it as a standard version of Wine, you can create a file that does this automatically. </p>

<p<p> The first command tells Wine to switch to 32-bit mode, and the second command tells where to create a new folder ("." at the end hides the folder - you can delete it if you want). Since this folder does not exist, the third team creates it for us. </p>

                How to run Windows applications and games with Linux Wine
              Is there a way to run Windows software on Linux? One answer is to use wine, but although it can be very useful, it should probably be your last resort. That's why

However, the wine is not perfect. Some programs require work, while others do not work at all. In addition to this, the following steps will increase your chances of running Windows programs on your Linux computer. </p>

<h2 id="14"> Why Is My Program Not Working? </h2>

<p> Wine Staging contains many fixes and features that were not available in consumer versions. Because of this, you may be more likely to get and run your programs if you use them instead. Specific instructions for your Linux distribution can be found on their website. </p>

<h2 id="15"> Use Native Windows Components With Winetricks </h2>

<p> Then click the Windows version button. You will see a list of the various editions of Windows that Wine can emulate. If you are using 32-p   the version of Wine, releases prior to Windows XP will be displayed, since they were available only in 32-bit mode. </p>
